  **Starter** Checkout is for you who want Swedbank Pay to handle everything.
menu_order: 200

This is the option where Swedbank Pay does it all. Verifying your consumer,
collecting billing and shipping addresses, storing consumer information and
providing you with the full range of available payment methods.

The only way of integrating our **Starter** implementation is **Seamless View**.

With **Seamless View**, the payer stays at your site, and you initiate the
Swedbank Pay authentication and purchase module in an iframe. The checkin and
purchase component will be styled by Swedbank Pay.

Read more about the integration by clicking the link below.

While the payment menu supports Danish `da-DK`, English (US) `en-US`, Finnish
`fi-FI`, Norwegian `nb-NO`, and Swedish `sv-SE`, our Checkin only supports
English (US) `en-US`, Norwegian `nb-NO`, and Swedish `sv-SE`. We strongly advise
you to use a language which is supported in both modules for the best user
experience.
